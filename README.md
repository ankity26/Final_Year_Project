# 🧠 Early Detection of Alzheimer’s Disease Using AI

A deep learning–based system for the **early detection of Alzheimer’s Disease** from **MRI brain scans**, built using **PyTorch** and deployed with a **Streamlit web interface**.

This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can assist in analyzing MRI scans for early-stage Alzheimer's — providing fast, interpretable, and explainable insights.

## 🧩 Example Output

| MRI Input      | Grad-CAM Heatmap                       | Classification |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 🧠 Brain slice | 🔥 Attention on temporal region        | ✅ Healthy     |
| 🧠 Brain slice | 🔥 Diffuse activation near hippocampus | ⚠️ Alzheimer   |

---

## 📊 Results

| Metric                  | Value |
| ----------------------- | ----- |
| **Training Accuracy**   | ~92%  |
| **Validation Accuracy** | ~88%  |
| **Testing Accuracy**    | ~85%  |

The Grad-CAM visualization highlights regions of the brain contributing most to the model’s prediction — often aligning with areas clinically associated with Alzheimer’s disease, such as the **hippocampus** and **temporal lobe**.
